Sanity check of `examples/NERCRF.py` 
- **checked io:** I outputted one epoch of train, dev, test data. They are the same as the raw dataset.
- **Network structure and parameters:** I printed them out. The model is all the same.
- **Optimizer:** I printed out the learning rate every epoch. the same as the output of Alexa_NER_GCN
- **args:** I went through arguments one by one
